## 💰 Revenue Model (As Specified)

```
For every sale made by a referred seller:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Sale Amount: £100.00                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Seller Keeps: £90.00 (90%)         │
│ Platform Fee: £10.00 (10%)         │
│   ↳ Referrer Gets: £3.00 (30% of fee = 3% of sale) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Formula:**
- Platform takes: 10% of every sale
- Referrer earns: 30% of that 10% = **3% of total sale**
- This is **passive income for life** from referred sellers

---
