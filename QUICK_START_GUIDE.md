## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations (2 mins)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Run these files **in order**:

   **First:**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste: supabase/migrations/20251023000000_referral_system.sql
   -- This creates the core referral tables and logic
   ```

   **Second:**
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste: supabase/migrations/20251023000001_fraud_detection.sql
   -- This adds fraud detection features
   ```

4. Click **Run** for each one
5. ✅ Database is ready!

---

### Step 2: Test the System (3 mins)

#### A. Test User Flow

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Sign up as User A** (the referrer)
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/auth
   - Create account

3. **Get referral link**
   - Navigate to `/referrals`
   - Copy your unique referral link

4. **Sign up as User B** (the referred user)
   - Open referral link in incognito mode
   - Sign up (you'll be linked to User A automatically)

5. **See it work!**
   - Check User A's dashboard
   - You should see User B as a referral

#### B. Test Admin Features

1. **Make yourself admin:**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
   VALUES ('your-user-id', 'admin');
   ```

2. **Visit admin dashboard:**
   - Go to `/admin/referrals`
   - Explore the management interface

## 💰 How It Works

```
1. User shares referral link
   ↓
2. Friend signs up through link (tracked automatically)
   ↓
3. Friend becomes a seller
   ↓
4. Friend makes sales (e.g., £100)
   ↓
5. Platform takes £10 (10% fee)
   ↓
6. Referrer gets £3 (30% of £10 = 3% of sale)
   ↓
7. Commission added to referrer's balance automatically
   ↓
8. Referrer requests payout when balance ≥ £25
   ↓
9. Admin approves payout
   ↓
10. Referrer gets paid!
```
